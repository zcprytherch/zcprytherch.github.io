This is my Christmas present.

It's my public facing website but also is a collection of things I'm going to
learn (with my husband's help!):

- Using a developer level text editor (I'm going to learn to use
  [atom](https://atom.io/)).
- Learning the basics of web development: mainly markdown.
- Using version control.

This Christmas present also comes with a life long supply of technical support
from my husband.
